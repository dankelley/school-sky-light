<p>Most of us have noticed that the sky darkens in the minutes before an 
afternoon downpour.  Patient weather observers witness hours of darkening, as a 
front rolls in.  In effect, these are local, short-term weather predictions 
based on sky brightness.   Regional, longer-term predictions could also be 
made, if observations could be linked together.  For example, a storm running 
up the coast of Nova Scotia would darken Lunenburg skies well in advance
of bad weather in Halifax.</p>

<p>The question is how to set up a network with enough stations to be of use.  
This could be done by Environment Canada, at great expense.  But why should
civil servants have all the fun?  With today's technology, the whole program 
could be done in schools, by students.  That is the idea of SkyView.</p>

<p>Putting sensors in schools will give excellent spatial coverage, because all 
populated areas have schools.  Since schools already have computers, data 
logging and transmission will not require new infrastructure.  As for the work 
of building sensors, calibrating them, connecting them to a network, creating 
analysis tools, etc., this could all be done by the students.  This is the real
point of SkyView: to show students that they can do cutting-edge scientific and
technical work.</p> 

<p>SkyView offers broad learning experiences, in environmental sciences, basic 
sciences, mathematics, and computing.  There are also roles for students more
interested in business and management (organizing the scientists!), in
communication and public relations (websites, lectures, etc.), and in such
fields as archaeology (observatories like Stonehenge) and history
(navigation).</p>

<p>The project need not be limited to the measurement of light. We now have
available a range of inexpensive sensors that measure aspects of weather that
were once the sole domain of professionals. Who knows what students might come
up with, once they get going?</p>

<p>Imagine what will happen when members of the public start to consult SkyView
for informal short-term local weather forecasts, and when professional weather
forecasters start to link the school data into longer-range weather
predictions. Imagine the pride students will feel, when they stand back and
look at what they have done.</p>
