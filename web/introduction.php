<p>Most of us have noticed that the sky darkens in the minutes before an 
afternoon downpour.  Patient weather observers witness hours of darkening, as a 
front rolls in.  In effect, these are local, short-term weather predictions 
based on sky brightness.   Regional, longer-term predictions could also be 
made, if observations could be linked together.  For example, a storm running 
up the coast of Nova Scotia would darken Lunenburg skies well in advance
of bad weather in Halifax.</p>

<p>The question is how to set up a network with enough stations to be of use.  
This could be done by Environment Canada, at great expense.  But why should
civil servants have all the fun?  With today's technology, the whole program 
could be done in schools, by students.  That is the idea of SkyView.</p>

<p>Putting sensors in schools will give excellent spatial coverage, because all 
populated areas have schools.  Since schools already have computers, data 
logging and transmission will not require new infrastructure.  As for the work 
of building sensors, calibrating them, connecting them to a network, creating 
analysis tools, etc., this could all be done by the students.  This is the real 
point of SkyView: to show students that they are capable of doing cutting-edge 
scientific and technical work.</p> 

<p>SkyView offers broad learning experiences, in environmental sciences, basic 
sciences, mathematics, and computing.  There are also roles for students more 
interested in business and management (organizing the scientists!), in communication 
and public relations (websites, lectures, etc.), in
such fields as archaeology (observatories like Stonehenge) and history 
(navigation).</p>

<p>There project need not be limited to the measurement of light.  With modern 
micro-controllers and sensors, students could measure many aspects of weather 
that were once the domain of the professionals.  The popularity of robot 
competitions in schools is proof that students have the ability to do this sort 
of work, and the interest to do so.</p>

<p>Over time, members of the public would start to consult SkyView for informal 
short-term local weather forecasts.  The pride that students would feel, 
knowing that, is justification enough for the project.</p>
