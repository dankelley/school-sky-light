<p>
The sky darkens in the minutes before an afternoon downpour.  Patient observers 
will notice that the sky darkens in the hours before a front arrives.  These 
are predictions of local weather that might be valid across a city.  Since weather moves in 
patterns, one might wonder whether a network of sky observers might be able to
make predictions that would be useful over larger regions, such as provinces.</p>

<p>But not everyone can spend the day watching the sky and chatting on the
phone.  The solution is to set up a network of automated light sensors.  This
could be done in a professional way, at professional costs.  The SkyNet program
proposes another solution: put the sensors in schools.  All populated areas
have schools, so good spatial coverage is ensured.  And, since schools already
have computers, data recording will not require new infrastructure.  As for the
sensors, students are capable of building them, calibrating them, and
interfacing them to computers.</p>

<p>This seems to be an exercise in child labour.  Far from it.  Actually,
SkyNet is a thinly-disguised learning experience.  Science-minded students
would benefit from observing the atmosphere, and thinking about the general
Physics involved, including convection, waves, and fronts.  Students with
interests in engineering and computing would gain much from setting up and
calibrating the equipment, and linking sensors to computers.  There are obvious
opportunities for students interested in statistics.  Management-minded students
could organize the work teams, while business-minded students could take care
of the finances and deal with local sponsors.  Writers will be needed to
explain the work, and public speakers could communicate with the media and the
public.  SkyNet will offer insights on history, because observing the sky was
once a serious thing, for navigation, agriculture, and so forth.  The list goes
on.  Simply stated, SkyNet could offer much, to many students.</p>

<p>There project need not be limited to the measurement of light.  With modern
micro-controllers and sensors, students could measure many aspects of weather
that were once the domain of the professionals.  Students are both enthusiastic
and capable, as the popularity of robotic competitions indicates.</p>

<p>It seems likely that people would start to consult SkyNet for informal
short-term local weather forecasts.  It is not hard to imagine the pride that
students would feel when that happens.</p>
