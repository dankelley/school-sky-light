Despite the accuracy of weather forecasts over intervals of days,
people examine sky darkness to the to see if a downpour is imminent, or whether 
a storm is ending.  This sort of short-range weather prediction has proven 
useful for uncounted years.  The eye tells much.
</p>

<p>
Today, though, there is something new.  We can <i>combine</i> many eyes.  If 
a storm is coming up the coast, people in Yarmouth will see darkening skies 
before their friends in Halifax do, and a simple phone call could create a 
reasonable forecast for a few hours span.  And, of course, the forecast would 
get better if people in Bridgewater joined conversation.  A dozen friends (with 
time on their hands) could do a reasonable job of tracking a storm over a 
100-kilometre interval.

<p>
However, people generally lack the time watch the sky all day long, and phoning 
becomes impractical when more than a small number of friends are involved.  The 
best plan is to automate things.  There are two ways to do this.  One is to get 
Environment Canada to do it.  Certainly, they could do it well, if given more 
resources.  But why should they have all the fun?  With today's technology, it 
is possible for members of the public to set up the sensor network.

<p>
This is where SkyNet comes in.  It is a project to put sky-brightness sensors 
in schools.  This placement will good spatial coverage, because all populated 
areas have schools.  Costs will be kept down by having the work be done by 
students, for whom this could provide diverse learning opportunities (and a 
great deal of fun).  The devices themselves (described elsewhere on this 
website) would be constructed by students, who would also calibrate the 
sensors, perform statistical analyses, feed the data into web streams, and so 
forth.  The work would teach students not just about meteorology, but also 
enginnering, electronics, statistics, and computing design.  Students not 
inclined in such ways could participate  by organizing teams, doing public 
outreach, and so forth.  Schools could compete to deploy more sensors and to 
invent new ways to process the data.  They could also design new sensors, for 
such things as barometric pressure, humudity, and wind speed; many things that 
were once complicated are now reasonably easy, partly because of a 
do-it-yourself movement involving microcontrollers in robotics.
</p>

<p>
Everything about the project is within easy reach.  The sensors could be built 
for about $50 each, so any school could afford to build several.  Computers are 
already in the classroom, so networking will be easy.  Setting up a "cloud" for 
computing should not be hard, and would give opportunities for local companies 
to participate.
</p>

<p>
This project should be interesting to many students, and it affords a wealth of 
learning opportunities.  And it seems likely that students would feel 
considerable excitement, when they see that they can predict weather in a way 
that joins together ancient "sky watching" methods with the latest in 
electronics and computing.
