<p> The sky darkens quickly before a sudden downpour, and slowly as a front
comes in over the course of a few hours.  This is why, even with modern
forecasts, people rely on sky brightness as a rough predictor of local weather
changes over short time intervals.  This works locally, but it could be made to
work over larger distances.  If a storm rolls northeast up the coast of Nova
Scotia, skies will darken in Yarmouth a few hours before bad weather gets to
Halifax.  The same goes for other directions of storm travel, and so a network
of observers could create a crude "weather forecast" simply by observing skies
and making phone calls.  </p>

<p> But most people can't watch the sky all day, and are not willing to make
dozens of phone calls every hour.  Luckily, it is easy to automate the whole
process.  This is where SkyNet comes in.  The idea is to place sky brightness
sensors in the schools.  This has the advantage of providing good coverage
across populated regions.  Also, schools have computers that can be used to log
the observations and distribute them.  And, finally and most importantly, the
process provides diverse learning experiences for students.  </p>

<p>The devices themselves (described elsewhere on this website) would be
constructed by the students.  And the students would also calibrate the
sensors, invent and perform statistical analyses, pour the data into web
streams, and so forth.  In doing this work (which they would likely regard as
play), they would learn about much more than meteorology.  Technically-minded students
would enjoy honing skills in engineering, electronics, statistics, and
computing.  Business-minded students could participate by organizing team-work,
working with sponsors, or commercializing their results.  Students interested
in writing could do public outreach.  Historians won't be left out, because
studying the sky was the basis of navigation until just a few decades ago.  The
list goes on; the point is that SkyNet could offer much, to many students.</p>

<p>There is no reason for the project to end with the measurement of light.
Students could also design new sensors, to measure such things as barometric
pressure, humidity, and wind speed.  Many things that were complicated to
measure a generation ago are now within easy reach.  We are living in an era of
do-it-yourself computing and microcontrol, a particularly relevant component of
which is the growing interest in robotics in schools.  </p>

<p>It seems likely that people would start to consult SkyNet for informal
short-term local weather forecasts.  Can anyone doubt the excitement, and
pride, that students would feel when that happens?</p>
