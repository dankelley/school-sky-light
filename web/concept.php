Despite the accuracy of weather forecasts over days and hundreds of kilometers, 
people still look up to the sky when deciding whether to run to a bus shelter.  
What they are doing is making short-range weather predictions based on changes 
in sky brightness.

This works reasonably well, but it can be improved by 
observing the sky at several locations at the same time.  If a storm is coming 
up the coast, people in Yarmouth will see darkening skys before their friends 
in Halifax do.  What if we could get many observers, and get them to 
communicate often?  Could we form an informal weather prediction scheme?
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to set up a sky-observing network.  One is to get 
Environment Canada to do it.  Certainly, they could do it well, given more 
resources.  But why should they have all the fun?  With today's technology, it 
is possible for members of the public to set up the sensor network, in a 
measurement analog to the WikiPedia project.

SkyNet is intended to spearhead this project, and to do it in a way that has a 
larger aim.  The idea is to put the sensors in schools.  This will yield good 
sampling coverage, because all populated areas have schools.  More importantly, 
perhaps, it provides educational opportunities for students, for it is they who 
will construct the devices, calibrate them, network them, and develop web-based 
tools to analyse and distribute the data.  There are numerous educational 
opportunities in Skynet, for students interested in weather, of course, but 
also for students interested in electronics, in computers, in statistics, in 
organizing teams, in communicating with the public, and so on.

<p>
Everything about the project is within reach.  The sensors could be built for 
about $50 each, so any school could afford one on each side of the school, or 
even one in each classroom.   Computers are already in the classroom, so 
networking will be easy.  Setting up a "cloud" for computing should not be 
hard, and would give opportunities for local companies (or even environment 
Canada) to help out.
</p>

<p>
This project may be interesting to students even at the very early stages, and
should garner more and more attention as widening data streams suggest widening
application.
