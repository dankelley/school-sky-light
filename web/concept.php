Despite the accuracy of weather forecasts over long intervals, people examine 
the brightness of the sky, to see if they should rush to avoid a downpour, and 
to see whether a storm is coming to an end.  This method of short-range weather 
prediction has proven itself over uncounted years.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, we can do better, by combine observations spread out over wide areas.  
If a storm is coming up the coast, people in Yarmouth will see darkening skies 
before their friends in Halifax do, and so a phone call yields a forecast that 
will be reasonably valid over a few hours.  And the forecast could very well 
improve, if people in Bridgewater joined conversation.  Indeed, a dozen friends 
(with time on their hands) could do a reasonable job of tracking a storm over a 
province.

The problem is that people lack the time watch the sky for hours on end, and 
phoning is not practical when if the number of observers gets large.  Clearly, 
the solution is to automate the observation and the reporting, and two methods 
come to mind.  One is to get Environment Canada to do it.  Certainly, they 
could do it, given the resources.  But that would be expensive.  Besides, why 
should civil servants have all the fun?  With today's technology, it is 
entirely possible for the public to set up the sensor network.

The SkyNet project proposes to establish a sensor network in schools.  This 
will good spatial coverage, because all populated areas have schools.  Costs 
will be low because the work be done by students, for whom this could provide 
diverse learning opportunities--and a great deal of fun.  The devices 
themselves (described elsewhere on this website) would be constructed by 
the students.  And the students would also calibrate the sensors, perform 
statistical analyses, feed the data into web streams, and so forth.  In doing 
this work (which they would likely regard as play), they would learn
not just about meteorology, but also enginnering, electronics, statistics, and 
computing.  Students not inclined in such ways could participate  by organizing 
teams, doing public outreach, and so forth.  There are even opportunities for 
students interested in history and archaeology, because observing the sky was 
once a very large focus for people.  Teamwork skills would be honed by doing 
the work, and it seems likely that schools would find ways to engage in 
friendly competition to get the best data, or to make the best weather 
predictions.

There is no reason for the project to end with the measurement of light.  
Students could also design new sensors, to measure such things as barometric 
pressure, humudity, and wind speed.  Many things that were complicated to 
measure a generation ago are now within easy reach.  We are living in an era of 
do-it-yourself computing and microcontrol, a particularly relevant component of 
which is the growing interest in robotics in schools.
</p>

<p>
Everything about the project is within easy reach.  The sensors could be built 
for about $50 each, so schools could afford to build several.  Computers are 
already in the classrooms, so data logging and networking will be easy.  
Setting up a "cloud" for computing will be beyond the students, but would provide
good opportunities for local companies (or, beter yet, universities) to 
participate.
</p>

<p>
It seems likely that students would feel considerable excitement, when they see 
that they can predict short-term local weather as well as the national weather service.
