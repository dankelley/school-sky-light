The graph indicates temporal variation of light intensity in an office in Halifax, Nova Scotia, updated at 10-minute intervals based on 1-minute averages of data measured at 10-second intervals.  Readings of about 80% result from the use of overhead lights in the office.  The graph below shows some early tests with detection of sunrise and sunset times, from which students could infer the location of the observation, teaching something that their seafaring ancesters would have understdood easily.
