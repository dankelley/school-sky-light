Trying to infer lat and lon from sunrise and sunset.  If I fix lat and fit for lon, it's within the
width of Nova Scotia (fit-1.pdf).  The same goes for fixing lon and fitting for lat.  But when I fit
for both lat and lon, the answer is consistently off, with locations being in Quebec/Labrador
(map.pdf).   I don't think the problem is with the fact that times are rounded to the minute
(rise-set-timing.pdf).  I don't think the problem is with the width of the solar disk (temporary
tests, not producing graphs).
