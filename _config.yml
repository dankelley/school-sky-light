title: School sky light project
description: Many weather events are signalled by changes in sky brightness.When the sky darkens quickly, people know to take cover from impending rain. Today, it is easy to make cheap devices to measure sky brightness, and this website explains how a network of such devices could be built and networked by schoolchildren. This opens up many educational opportunities for students with a wide range of interests, and students would be motivated by hearing of their work in weather reports.
