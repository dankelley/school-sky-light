title: School sky light project
description: It's easy to make cheap devices to measure and report skylight intensity, which can be a good measure of weather changes over sub-hour intervals.  This website suggests the creation of a network of such devices, built and maintained by schoolchildren. There are many educational opportunities in this, and it would be exciting for students to hear their project spoken of in weather forecasts.<br> [overview](index.md) | [methods](methods.md) | [results](results.md)
